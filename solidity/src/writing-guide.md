## Metaphors

### Example: Lists and Queues

If your queue is a list, then you will append at the tail and extract from the head. But if your queue is a beast, then you feed the head and excrete from the tail.


So this is where it settles out for me: I want to disambiguate, making it obvious which end is which. The terms head and tail are provably ambiguous and confusing, so they should not be used regardless of the metaphor.

> If your metaphor is list, then use front and back. You read from the front and you write to the back.

> If your metaphor is beast, then use mouth and anus. It just makes sense.
