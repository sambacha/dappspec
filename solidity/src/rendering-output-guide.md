## Typeface

[https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf)

The typeface in which a symbol appears helps to define what the symbol represents. For example, irrespective of the typeface
used in the surrounding text, “A” would be typed or typeset in

— italic type for the scalar quantity area: A;
— roman type for the unit ampere: A;
— italic boldface for the vector quantity vector potential: A .

### Rules

More specifically, the three major categories of symbols found in scientific and technical publications should be typed or typeset
in either italic or roman type, as follows:

— symbols for quantities and variables: italic;
— symbols for units: roman;
— symbols for descriptive terms: roman.

### Descriptive terms — roman
Symbols representing purely descriptive terms (for example, the chemical elements) are roman, as are symbols representing
mathematical constants that never change (for example, p) and symbols representing explicitly defined functions or well defined
operators (for example, G(x ) or div):

### Quantities and variables — italic
Symbols for quantities are italic, as are symbols for functions in general, for example, f (x ):


### Typeface 

Superscripts and subscripts are in italic type if they represent variables, quantities, or running numbers. They are in roman type if they are descriptive.

subscript category		typeface		proper usage 
quantity		italic		cp, specific heat capacity at constant pressure
descriptive		roman		mp, mass of a proton
running number		italic
